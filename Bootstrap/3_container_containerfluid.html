            1. Chhota Bheem and the Stolen Laddoos One morning in Dholakpur,
            Bheem woke up excited to eat his favorite laddoos. But when he
            reached the kitchen, all the laddoos were missing! The villagers
            were worried because the King’s feast was that evening. Bheem,
            Chutki, and Jaggu started searching the village. They followed sweet
            crumbs that led them to Kalia, who had hidden the laddoos to take
            credit for saving the day. Bheem calmly talked to Kalia and
            explained that teamwork is more important than showing off. Feeling
            ashamed, Kalia returned the laddoos. Everyone praised Bheem for his
            kindness, and the feast was a grand success.

            2. Doraemon’s Magical Pencil Nobita was scared because he had a
            drawing competition at school. Doraemon gave him a magical pencil
            that could bring drawings to life. Nobita drew a beautiful bird, and
            it flew around the room! Soon, Nobita started misusing the pencil,
            creating shortcuts for everything. But the drawings began causing
            trouble. Doraemon explained that magic cannot replace hard work.
            Nobita apologized and returned the pencil. He practiced sincerely
            and won second prize, learning a valuable lesson about effort and
            honesty

            his school picnic. On the way, he played pranks on his friends,
            making everyone laugh. But when Kazama got lost in the forest,
